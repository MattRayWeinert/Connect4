# Connect4
My attempt at recreating the classic game, Connect 4, with the help of Java.
It is capable of playing against another player and will execute until
someone has won. Multiple functions used to print the board, place the chip
or even to iteratively backtrack to check for the winner.
<ul>
  <li>Programed in Java using Eclipse and the JDK framework</li>
  <li>Utilized multiple functions to backtrack for a 4 in a row</li>
</ul>
